            <p>In this project, I worked on creating a new and improved logo of the Phone 
                application and this is the final product which I had come up with. It consists
                of a green background and design similar to a rotary phone which i drew inspiration 
                from.

            <p>In this project, I was tasked with creating a splash page for the Phone app which I 
                focused on in the previous project. This time I was to make a splash page which 
                encapsulated the core functions and components of the Phone app. I went to a simple 
                design with the same rotary phone design with a number pad in the background.

            <p>In this project, I created a demographic for the Phone app with some details about 
                the phone app and other statistics and facts about the Phone app and its users. It 
                also talks about some of the functionalities of the Phone app and includes some designs 
                referencing the Phone app to make the conclusion that the demographic is about the 
                Phone app. The most evident one of all being the enlarged rotary phone design in the 
                middle of the demographic.

            <p>In this project, I made a building game using Python programming for my Programming 
                module. The aim was to display a grid and to be able to fill up those grids with 
                "buildings" and the game would end when the grid was fully filled up. The points 
                for the game would then be tallied and displayed. If there was a new highscore, 
                the player could add their name to the highscore list.
