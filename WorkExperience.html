            <h2>Popular Holdings Cashier</h2>
            <p class="history">Worked at a Popular Bookstore branch as a cashier for 2 months to get some working experience 
                and experience the working environment. There I learned to work the Point Of Sales (POS) and how to properly 
                service the customers and ensure that they had a pleasant experience while shopping at the bookstore. I also 
                had to learn how to work with other people and in teams which also helped to improve my people skills and 
                communication skills. The other employees there were also very helpful and patient with me especially when I 
                did not understand certain parts of the job This experience was a very insightful one which helped me to take 
                a peek into the working society and to figure out what kind of environment i would be working in and what the 
                people around me do.
