# ID-Assignment-1

For this project, I have created a web page to use as a personal portfolio website for myself. The purpose is to be able to present myself and my assets in the best possible light and to possibly get hired by potential recruiters. The website includes an about me page which describes me and has details about myself. Another page which displays my educational history, a page to display my work experience, another page to show past projects which I have worked on, and a final contact me page which consists of a form which users can submit their personal details to contact me.

# Design Process
In my design process, I created a wireframe to help guide me on what content I would want to place on my website and how the general layout of the website would look like when I created it.

Recruiters want to be able to know the background of the applicant to be able to gauge their abilities and their proficiency in certain aspects. This is where the page which shows my educational history and my work experience comes in. Combined, they help to show potential hirers what sort of academic achievements I have gotten in the past and what kind of working experience I had to see if I am well-versed in the profession which they are hiring me for. The website also includes a projects page which puts all my previous projects for school on display for hirers to get a glimpse of what kind of work I have done in the past and what I am capable of doing.

Recruiters would also want to be able to contact me to possibly further discuss my application if they think that I am what they are looking for. To adjust to this, the website has a footer which contains my contact details which include my phone number, my email address, and a link to my LinkedIN profile which they can also take a look at. Alternatively, they can also navigate to the "Contact Me" Page from which they would find a form which can be filled out with their name, their email, phone number and possibly any comments which they might want to make regarding my portfolio. They can them submit this form and would be notified by an alert on the screen which confirms their submission.

Recruiters might also want to be able to see what I look like, so I have included a picture portrait of myself on the home page of the website.

The wireframe which i designed for this assignment can be found with the rest of the files on github and on ICTSpace.


# Features

**Existing Features**

Feature 1: LinkedIn link at the footer of the page. This linkedIn link will redirect users to the LinkedIn website where they will be able to view my profile and all my personal details
Feature 2: A navigation bar where the user can select which content they would like to look at. For example, if they wanted to view my education history, they can click on the tab "Education History". This would take them to the page which displays all my education history. The tabs will also be highlighted when the user hovers their cursor over the tab. This would allow the user to accurately see which tab they are clicking on and to add some interactivity to the website.
Feature 3: Showing a shadow of the box/container when the user hovers their cursor over the box. 
Feature 4: A form which the users can submit by filling up the form with the correct format. For example they have to input an email address with the correct format to be able to submit the form. 
Feature 5: An alert which will pop up on the screen when the user submits the form, letting them know that their form has been submitted.

**Features Left to Implement**

Some potential features which could be implemented is to make the images of the projects on the "Projects" page highlighted or to focus on them when the user mouses over them.
